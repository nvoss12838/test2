The assignment for week 3 is reading files and using modules:

See week 2 on the geopug canvas page for some helful examples. 

A provided text file 18593LakeHanna.txt contains rain gauge data for Tampa. 
Read the text file into the script and plot daily rainfall levels. 

For reading the text you probably want to check out numpy loadtxt or genfromtxt

For dealing with the dates, check out python datetime or pandas modules

For plotting you probably want to use the matplotlib module

There is a second text file in the folder, with global volcanic events. This 
file will be trickier to read because there are lots of data gaps. Try and plot
the global volcanic eruptions by VEI on a map. The matplotlib.basemap module is a good place to start, other options include cartopy and GMTpy.
